        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for considering Google Maps, Google Earth and Street View for your project! These
          guidelines are for non-commercial use except for the limited use cases described below;
          if you want to use Google Maps, Google Earth, or Street View for other commercial
          purposes, please contact the <a href=
          "https://enterprise.google.com/maps/?_ga=1.246966925.880615344.1474903599#contact-form">Google
          Cloud Customer Team</a>. “Commercial purposes” means “use for sale or revenue-generating
          purposes”.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created this page to clarify questions we’ve received from users over the years
          regarding uses of our mapping tools in everything from marketing and promotional
          materials, films, television programs, books, academic journals, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, as long as you’re following our <a href=
          "https://www.google.com/intl/ALL/help/terms_maps.html">Terms of Service</a> and you’re
          <a href="../permissions/geoguidelines/attr-guide.html">attributing properly</a>, we’re
          cool with your using our maps and imagery; in fact, we love seeing all of the creative
          applications of Google Maps, Google Earth and Street View! But we know you’re looking for
          more specifics to ensure you’re using our maps and imagery correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you dive into the information below, we suggest starting with the general guidelines
          at the top, as these will apply to all projects. Then feel free to click directly to the

          general guidelines
        </h3>
        <h4>
          The Basics
        </h4>
        <p>
          Google Maps and Google Earth’s “Content” (as defined in the <a href=
          "https://www.google.com/intl/ALL/help/terms_maps.html">Google Earth/Google Maps
          Additional Terms of Service</a>) includes everything you’d find in these products: map
          and terrain data, imagery, business listings, traffic, reviews and other related
          information provided by Google, its licensors, and users.
        </p>
        <p>
          These guidelines cover your use of the Content—with one exception. There are some
          particular guidelines regarding your use of Street View imagery available from both
          Google Maps and Google Earth. Please read the <a href="#streetview">section below</a> for
          instructions on how Street View imagery may or may not be used.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Terms of Service
        </h4>
        <p>
          To help you figure out whether your use of the Content is acceptable, first read the
          following documents:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/ALL/policies/terms/">Google Terms of Service</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/ALL/help/terms_maps.html">Google Maps/Google Earth
            Additional Terms of Service</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your use of the Content is first and foremost governed by the licenses above.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Fair Use
        </h4>
        <p>
          Apart from any license granted to you by Google, your use of the Content may be
          acceptable under principles of "fair use." Fair use is a concept under copyright law in
          the U.S. that, generally speaking, permits you to use a copyrighted work in certain ways
          without obtaining a license from the copyright holder.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are similar, although generally more limited, concepts in other countries'
          copyright laws, including a concept known as "fair dealing" in a number of countries.
          Google can’t tell you if your use of the Content from our products would be fair use or
          would be considered fair dealing; these are legal analyses that depend on all of the
          specific facts of your proposed use. We suggest you speak with an attorney if you have
          questions regarding fair use of copyrighted works.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Written permission
        </h4>
        <p>
          Due to limited resources and high demand, we're unable to sign any letter or contract
          specifying that your project or use has our explicit permission. As long as you follow
          the guidance on this page, and attribute the Content correctly, feel free to move forward
          with your project.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Attribution
        </h4>
        <p>
          All uses of the Content must provide attribution to both Google and our data providers.
          We require clear, visible attribution when the Content is shown. You may not move the
          attribution to the end credits or fade it out after a few seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that if you <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3544418?hl=en">embed a
          classic map, Street View panorama</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/">My
          Map</a>; use one of our <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps?hl=en">APIs</a> on
          the web or in an application; or export a video or JPEG from <a href=
          "https://support.google.com/earth/?hl=en#topic=4363013">Google Earth Pro</a>, the
          necessary attribution is already baked into the map and no further credit is needed.
          Learn more about how to properly credit, as well as how to identify providers, on our
          <a href="../permissions/geoguidelines/attr-guide.html">attribution guidelines page</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are unwilling to meet our attribution requirements, contact our data provider(s)
          directly to inquire about purchasing the rights to use the Content directly. You’ll find
          provider contact information listed on their websites.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Personalizing your map
        </h4>
        <p>
          You may annotate our maps with additional information—like points, lines or labels. In
          fact, many of our tools have built-in features that make it easy to do just that. For
          example, <a href="https://www.google.com/mymaps">Google My Maps</a> lets you <a href=
          "https://support.google.com/mymaps/answer/3024837?hl=en">draw lines and shapes</a> on a
          Google map. We also offer a <a href=
          "https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/">Styling Wizard</a> that
          allows you to edit the colors of individual map components (for example, changing water
          to purple), as well as toggle visibility for each component (for example, making roads
          invisible). If neither of those fit your needs, you may <a href=
          "https://support.google.com/earth/answer/148146?hl=en">save an image</a> from Google
          Earth and use Photoshop to add custom text labels.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we encourage annotations, you must not significantly alter how Google Maps, Google
          Earth or Street View would look online. For example, you're not allowed to make any
          changes to the colors of the product interface or alter how imagery appears (such as
          adding clouds or other natural elements, blurring, etc.).
        </p>
        <h3 class="important" id="maps-print">
          uses in print
        </h3>
        <p>
          Google Maps and Google Earth have built-in print functionality. You may print Content for
          non-commercial use and enlarge it (for example, a map with directions). In all uses where
          you will distribute printed materials that include the Content, first be sure to read the
          <a href="#general-guidelines">general guidelines</a> above, especially with regard to
          fair use and attribution.

          uses in television and film
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you’d like to use the Content on television or in a film (for example, a news
          broadcast or documentary), please first review the <a href="#general-guidelines">general
          guidelines</a> at the top of this page, especially with regard to attribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd like to use the Content in a substantial way on television or in film, you must
          accept the terms of our free broadcast license. Please <a href=

          If your project includes a minor scene in which one of our mapping tools is

          demonstrates how they used the Content in their research—you do not need a broadcast
          license. For these cases, no additional attribution is required on-screen; you may just

          Embeddable maps
        </h4>
        <p>
          We have <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps?hl=en">multiple APIs</a> available to
          help you build and embed custom maps, including Street View, within your website or
          application. When using these APIs, certain restrictions may apply. If you simply need to
          embed a classic Google map or Street View panorama on your website, learn how to easily
          do so <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3544418?hl=en">here</a>.

        <h4>
          Google Earth images
        </h4>
        <p>
          We know the imagery in Google Earth, both current and <a href=
          "https://support.google.com/earth/answer/148094?hl=en">historical</a>, can provide useful
          visual context to news websites, blogs, and other educational sites. And often these
          sites want to use the imagery found in Google Earth as still images, both as-is or
          annotated with additional labels and features. You may use a handful of these images in a
          news article or on a blog, just please be sure to follow our <a href=
          "../permissions/geoguidelines/attr-guide.html">attribution rules</a>. Note that <a href=
          "https://support.google.com/earth/?hl=en#topic=4363013">Google Earth Pro</a> allows you
          to export high-resolution JPEGs—particularly handy for these projects.

          If you’re using a Google Earth tour in your film and uploading it to YouTube, please do!
          If you’re just planning to distribute your video online, no explicit permission is
          required for your project. Same <a href=

        <ul>
          <li>the imagery is embedded or linked on your website using the HTML and URL provided on
