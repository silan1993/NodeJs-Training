        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            We typically do not approve the use of our logo for events we sponsor. If you're
            working with us on an event, please work with your Google contact to obtain permission

            Yes, you may include Google on your in-kind donor list and you may publish our logo on
            your site. We also have a standard statement that you can use to acknowledge your
            grant:

            If you're a Google Certified Partner of any of <a href=
            "https://www.google.com/adwords/partnerprograms/">our Partner Programs</a>, you may use
            your GCP badge on your site and other marketing material, but we cannot give you
            permission to use the logo. Please use your badge instead.

            our <a href="https://www.google.com/adwords/partnerprograms/">certification

            Google receives lots of requests every day to sponsor many worthy events and

          <p>
            Yes you do need permission in order to use it. However Google does not own the images
            found via Google Search. You must contact the owner of the image (typically whoever
            first posted the image on the web) and obtain his/her permission in order to use it.

            print or digital formats for an instructive or illustrative purpose provided that you

            superimpose graphics, photos, or ad copy on the screenshot or change the look of the
            screen-captured image in any other way. Outside of screenshots, you do need to obtain
            our permission to use the Google logo.

          What is a trademark?
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            A trademark is a word, name, symbol or device (or a combination thereof) that
            identifies the goods or services of a person or company and distinguishes them from the
            goods and services of others. A trademark assures consumers of consistent quality with
            respect to those goods or services and aids in their promotion. Read a list of <a href=
            "../permissions/trademark/our-trademarks.html">Google's trademarks</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="suez-zippy">
          Why is it important to use marks correctly?
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Rights to a trademark can survive indefinitely if an owner continues to use a mark to
            identify its goods and services. If trademarks are not used properly, they may become
            weak or lapse-putting one of the company's most important assets at risk. Rights may be
            lost not only by a trademark owner's improper use of its mark, but also by improper use
            of the mark by third parties or the public. Please use Google's trademarks consistent
            with the <a href="../permissions/trademark/rules.html">Rules for Proper Usage</a>.

        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            You will need to contact the trademark owner for permission. For more details, please
            review <a href=

        <div>
          <p>
            We cannot approve any company names or application names that incorporate a Google
            trademark, or that are confusingly similar to Google's trademarks. If you state that
            your product is compatible with a Google product, the product must actually be
            compatible with that Google product. Any notice that your product is compatible with a
            Google product should be made in a referential matter using phrases such as "for" or
            "compatible with" or "for use with." If reference is made to a Google trademark in
            connection with your logo, your logo must be larger than the Google trademark. The
            first instance of the Google trademark should contain the TM symbol. Examples: "XYZ
            software for Android™" or "ABC plug-in for Google Chrome™".
