        <h2>
          Our complete brand terms and conditions
        </h2>
        <p>
          If Google approves your request to use any Google trademarks, logos, web pages, screen
          shots, or other distinctive features ("Google Brand"), you agree to be bound by the
          following terms and conditions (the "Agreement").
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree to comply with the Guidelines for Third Party Use of Google Brand Features. So
          long as you do so, and provided that Google expressly approves your permission request,
          Google grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, royalty-free limited license to use
          the Google’s Brand Features set forth in your corresponding Permission Request Form for
          the sole purpose and only for the materials set forth therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any use of the Google Brand Features must be accompanied by a notice that clearly
          indicates that the Google Brand Features are trademarks or distinctive brand features of
          Google Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google reserves the right in its sole discretion to terminate or modify your permission
          to display the Google Brand Features and to take action against any use that does not
          conform to these terms and conditions, infringes any Google intellectual property or
          other right, or violates applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except as set forth above, nothing herein grants or should be deemed to grant to you any
          right, title or interest in or to the Google Brand Features. Your use of the Google Brand
          Features will inure to the benefit of Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree not to challenge or assist others to challenge the Google Brand Features
          (except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law), and you agree
          not to register or attempt to register any domain names, trademarks, trade names, or
          other distinctive brand features that are confusingly similar to those of Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Google Brand Features are provided "as is" and Google disclaims any warranties either
          expressed or implied by law regarding the Google Brand Features, including warranties of
          noninfringement. Furthermore, because you are not being charged for use of the Google
          Brand Features, in no event shall Google be liable to you for the subject matter of this
          Agreement under any theory of liability including for any direct, indirect, incidental,
          special, consequential, punitive, exemplary or other damages arising out of this
          Agreement or the use of the Google Brand Features. This limitation shall apply even if
          Google was or should have been aware or advised of the possibility of such damages and
          notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy stated herein.
          Some states do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for
          incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply
          to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not assign your rights or delegate your obligations under this Agreement without
          Google’s prior written consent. This Agreement is not intended to benefit, nor shall it
          be deemed to give rise to, any rights in any third party. This Agreement will be governed
          by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard
          to conflict of law principles. The venue for any dispute or claim arising out of or in
          connection with this Agreement shall be in Santa Clara County, California. The parties
          are independent contractors. Neither party shall be deemed to be an employee, agent,
          partner or legal representative of the other for any purpose and neither shall have any
          right, power or authority to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of the
          other. The waiver by Google of a breach of any provision hereof shall not be taken or
          held to be a waiver of the provision itself. If any provision of this Agreement is held
          by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be
          changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision
          to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
          remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, the Guidelines for Third Party Use of
          Google Brand Features, and the Permission Request Form, constitute the entire agreement
          between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
