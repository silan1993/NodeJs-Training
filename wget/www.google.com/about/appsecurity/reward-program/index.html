        Google Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) Rules
      </h1>
      <p>
        We have long enjoyed a close relationship with the security research community. To honor
        all the cutting-edge external contributions that help us keep our users safe, we maintain a
        Vulnerability Reward Program for Google-owned web properties, running continuously since
        November 2010.
      </p>
      <h2 id="scope">
        Services in scope
      </h2>
      <p>
        In principle, any Google-owned web service that handles reasonably sensitive user data is
        intended to be in scope. This includes virtually all the content in the following domains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>*.google.com
        </li>
        <li>*.youtube.com
        </li>
        <li>*.blogger.com
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bugs in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, Google-developed
        apps and extensions (published in <a href=
        "https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Google+LLC">Google Play</a>, in <a href=
        "https://itunes.apple.com/developer/google-inc/id281956209?mt=8">iTunes</a>, or in the
        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/ext/15-by-google">Chrome Web
        Store</a>), as well as some of our hardware devices (<a href=
        "https://madeby.google.com/home/">Home</a>, <a href="https://on.google.com/hub/">OnHub</a>
        and <a href="https://nest.com/">Nest</a>) will also qualify. See our <a href=
        "../android-rewards/">Android Rewards</a> and <a href="../chrome-rewards/">Chrome
        Rewards</a> for other services and devices that are also in scope.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the flip side, the program has two important exclusions to keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Third-party websites.</b> Some Google-branded services hosted in less common domains
          may be operated by our vendors or partners (this notably includes <q>zagat.com</q>). We
          can’t authorize you to test these systems on behalf of their owners and will not reward
          such reports. Please read the fine print on the page and examine domain and IP WHOIS
          records to confirm. If in doubt, talk to us first!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Recent acquisitions.</b> To allow time for internal review and remediation, newly
          acquired companies are subject to a six-month blackout period. Bugs reported sooner than
          that will typically not qualify for a reward.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="vulns">
        Qualifying vulnerabilities
      </h2>
      <p>
        Any design or implementation issue that substantially affects the confidentiality or
        integrity of user data is likely to be in scope for the program. Common examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cross-site scripting,
        </li>
        <li>Cross-site request forgery,
        </li>
        <li>Mixed-content scripts,
        </li>
        <li>Authentication or authorization flaws,
        </li>
        <li>Server-side code execution bugs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that the scope of the program is limited to technical vulnerabilities in Google-owned
        browser extensions, mobile, and web applications; please do not try to sneak into Google
        offices, attempt phishing attacks against our employees, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Out of concern for the availability of our services to all users, please do not attempt to
        carry out DoS attacks, leverage black hat SEO techniques, spam people, or do other
        similarly questionable things. We also discourage the use of any vulnerability testing
        tools that automatically generate very significant volumes of traffic.
      </p>
      <h2 id="notavuln">
        Non-qualifying vulnerabilities
      </h2>
      <div class="maia-promo">
        <strong>New!</strong> Visit our <a href=
        "https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln" target="_blank">Bug Hunter
        University</a> page dedicated to common non-qualifying findings and vulnerabilities.
      </div>
      <p>
        Depending on their impact, some of the reported issues may not qualify. Although we review
        them on a case-by-case basis, here are some of the common low-risk issues that typically do
        not earn a monetary reward:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vulnerabilities in *.bc.googleusercontent.com or *.appspot.com.</strong> These
          domains are used to host applications that belong to Google Cloud customers. The
          Vulnerability Reward Program does not authorize the testing of Google Cloud customer
          applications. Google Cloud customers can authorize the penetration testing of their own
          applications (<em><a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/" target="_blank">read
          more</a></em>), but testing of these domains is not within the scope of or authorized by
          the Vulnerability Reward Program.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in “sandbox” domains</strong> (<em><a href=
          "https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/xss-in-sandbox-domain" target=
          "_blank">read more</a></em>.) We maintain a number of domains that leverage the <a href=
          "http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Main/Part2#Same-origin_policy">same-origin
          policy</a> to safely isolate certain types of untrusted content; the most prominent
          example of this is <q>*.googleusercontent.com</q>. Unless an impact on sensitive user
          data can be demonstrated, we do not consider the ability to execute JavaScript in that
          domain to be a bug.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Execution of owner-supplied JavaScript in Blogger.</strong> Blogs hosted in
          <q>*.blogspot.com</q> are no different from any third-party website on the Internet. For
          your safety, we employ spam and malware detection tools, but we do not consider the
          ability to embed JavaScript within your own blog to be a security bug.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>URL redirection</strong> (<em><a href=
          "https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/open-redirect" target=
          "_blank">read more</a></em>.) We recognize that the address bar is the only reliable
          security indicator in modern browsers; consequently, we hold that the usability and
          security benefits of a small number of well-designed and closely monitored redirectors
          outweigh their true risks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate content proxying and framing.</strong> We expect our services to
          unambiguously label third-party content and to perform a number of abuse-detection
          checks, but as with redirectors, we think that the value of products such as Google
          Translate outweighs the risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bugs requiring exceedingly unlikely user interaction.</strong> For example, a
          cross-site scripting flaw that requires the victim to manually type in an XSS payload
          into Google Maps and then double-click an error message may realistically not meet the
          bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Logout cross-site request forgery</strong> (<em><a href=
          "https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/logout-xsrf" target=
          "_blank">read more</a></em>.) For better or worse, the design of HTTP cookies means that
          no single website can prevent its users from being logged out; consequently,
          application-specific ways of achieving this goal will likely not qualify. You may be
          interested in personal blog posts from <a href=
          "http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2010/01/logout-xsrf-significant-web-app-bug.html">
          Chris Evans</a> and <a href=
          "http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2010/10/http-cookies-or-how-not-to-design.html">Michal
          Zalewski</a> for more background.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flaws affecting the users of out-of-date browsers and plugins.</strong> The
          security model of the web is being constantly fine-tuned. The panel will typically not
          reward any problems that affect only the users of outdated or unpatched browsers. In
          particular, we exclude Internet Explorer prior to version 9.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Presence of banner or version information.</strong> Version information does not,
          by itself, expose the service to attacks - so we do not consider this to be a bug. That
          said, if you find outdated software and have good reasons to suspect that it poses a
          well-defined security risk, please let us know.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Monetary rewards aside, vulnerability reporters who work with us to resolve security bugs
        in our products will be credited on the <a href="../hall-of-fame/">Hall of Fame</a>. If we
        file an internal security bug, we will acknowledge your contribution on that page.

        The final amount is always chosen at the discretion of the reward panel. In particular, we
        may decide to pay higher rewards for unusually clever or severe vulnerabilities; decide to
        pay lower rewards for vulnerabilities that require unusual user interaction; decide that a
        single report actually constitutes multiple bugs; or that multiple reports are so closely
        related that they only warrant a single reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate
        your reward to an established charity. If you do so, we will double your donation - subject
        to our discretion. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a
        charity of our choosing.

      <p>
        When investigating a vulnerability, please, only ever target your own accounts. Never
        attempt to access anyone else's data and do not engage in any activity that would be

        Frequently asked questions
      </h2>
      <p>
        <em>Q: What if I found a vulnerability, but I don't know how to exploit it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: We expect that vulnerability reports sent to us have a valid <a href=
        "https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/improve/writing-the-perfect-attack-scenario"
        target="_blank">attack scenario</a> to qualify for a reward, and we consider it as a
        <a href="http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/11/exploitation-scenarios-matter-more-than.html"
        target="_blank">critical step</a> when doing vulnerability research. Reward amounts are
        decided based on the maximum impact of the vulnerability, and the panel is willing to
        reconsider a reward amount, based on new information (such as a chain of bugs, or a revised
        attack scenario).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: How do I demonstrate the severity of the bug if I’m not supposed to snoop
        around?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Please submit your report as soon as you have discovered a potential security issue. The
        panel will consider the maximum impact and will choose the reward accordingly. We routinely
        pay higher rewards for otherwise well-written and useful submissions where the reporter
        didn't notice or couldn't fully analyze the impact of a particular flaw.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: I found an outdated software (e.g. Apache or Wordpress). Does this qualify for a
        reward?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Please perform due diligence: confirm that the discovered software had any noteworthy
        vulnerabilities, and explain why you suspect that these features may be exposed and may
        pose a risk in our specific use. Reports that do not include this information will
        typically not qualify.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: Who determines whether my report is eligible for a reward?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The reward panel consists of the members of the Google Security Team. The current
        permanent members are Daniel Stelter-Gliese, Eduardo Vela Nava, Gábor Molnár, Krzysztof
        Kotowicz, Martin Straka, and Michael Jezierny. In addition there is a rotating member from
        <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/103663928590757646624/members/moderator">the
        rest of our team</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: What happens if I disclose the bug publicly before you had a chance to fix it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Please read our stance on <a href=
        "http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2010/07/rebooting-responsible-disclosure-focus.html">
        coordinated disclosure</a>. In essence, our pledge to you is to respond promptly and fix
        bugs in a sensible timeframe - and in exchange, we ask for a reasonable advance notice.
        Reports that go against this principle will usually not qualify, but we will evaluate them
        on a case-by-case basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: I wish to report an issue through a vulnerability broker. Will my report still
        qualify for a reward?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: We believe that it is against the spirit of the program to privately disclose the flaw
        to third parties for purposes other than actually fixing the bug. Consequently, such
        reports will typically not qualify.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: What if somebody else also found the same bug?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: First in, best dressed. You will qualify for a reward only if you were the first person
        to alert us to a previously unknown flaw.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: My employer / boyfriend / dog frowns upon my security research. Can I report a
        problem privately?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Sure. If you are selected as a recipient of a reward, and if you accept, we will need
        your contact details to process the payment. You can still request not to be listed on our
        public credits page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: What is bughunter.withgoogle.com?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The dashboard for the participants in Google’s VRP program. It dynamically creates the
        hall of fame, i.e., the 0x0A and honorable mentions lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: Do I need a profile on bughunter.withgoogle.com to participate in the VRP?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No. You can participate in the VRP under the same rules without the need of a profile.
        However, if you want your name to be listed in the 0x0A or the honorable mentions lists,
        you need to create a profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: Is the profile data publicly available?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes. The profile holds the data that is currently already available now on our hall of
        fame, i.e., on the 0x0A and honorable mentions lists. You can always leave these fields
        blank.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: How is the honorable mentions list sorted?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The hall of fame is sorted based on the volume of valid bug submissions, the ratio of
        valid vs. invalid submissions, and the severity of those submissions.

      <p>
        We are unable to issue rewards to individuals who are on sanctions lists, or who are in
        countries (e.g. Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) on sanctions lists. You are
        responsible for any tax implications depending on your country of residency and
        citizenship. There may be additional restrictions on your ability to enter depending upon
        your local law.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a competition, but rather an experimental and discretionary rewards program.
        You should understand that we can cancel the program at any time and the decision as to
        whether or not to pay a reward has to be entirely at our discretion.

        Of course, your testing must not violate any law, or disrupt or compromise any data that is
